# ft_linear_regression
A machine learning project implementing a simple linear regression algorithm from scratch.

# Overview
This project predicts car prices based on their mileage using linear regression with gradient descent. It consists of two main programs:

- Training program: Reads the dataset and performs linear regression to compute optimal theta values
- Prediction program: Uses trained parameters to predict prices for given mileage values

# Features

- Simple linear regression implementation without using ML libraries
- Gradient descent optimization
- Data visualization capabilities
- Model parameter saving/loading
